          <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
          <p>
            Sunway College @ Velocity currently does not have our own canteen.
            During the short lunch break, we needed to queue up with others at
            the food court to order food. Usually, the duration to order food
            could take up to 20 to 40 minutes, especially longer during lunch
            time. As a result, some might have either be late for class or skip
            their meal. Our project aims to help our community such as college
            students and lecturers to purchase food during the bustling study or
            working hours. We propose to develop a web application that allows
            the users within the community to manage their food ordering
            conveniently and flexibly. Having this application, the users can
            either save their time queuing up ordering food or rushing to grab
            food themselves during the short recess.
